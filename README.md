This repository demonstrates a common Perl bug related to comparing an undefined variable with a string using the 'eq' operator. The 'bug.pl' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.pl' provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from Perl's handling of undef values in comparisons.  Understanding this behavior is crucial for writing robust Perl code.
